abstract: "Ceria (CeO<sub>2</sub>) is one of the most extensively used rare earth oxides. Recently, it has been used as a support material for metal catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion. However, to date, the nature of metal/CeO<sub>2</sub> interfaces and their impact on electrochemical processes remains unclear. Here, a Cu-CeO<sub>2</sub> nanorod electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction catalyst is presented. Using operando analysis and computational techniques, it is found that, on the application of a reductive electrochemical potential, Cu undergoes an abrupt change in solubility in the ceria matrix converting from less stable randomly dissolved single atomic Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions to (Cu<sup>0</sup>,Cu<sup>1+</sup>) nanoclusters. Unlike single atomic Cu, which produces C<sub>1</sub> products as the main product during electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, the coexistence of (Cu<sup>0</sup>,Cu<sup>1+</sup>) clusters lowers the energy barrier for C-C coupling and enables the selective production of C<sub>2+</sub> hydrocarbons. As a result, the coexistence of (Cu<sup>0</sup>,Cu<sup>1+</sup>) in the clusters at the Cu-ceria interface results in a C<sub>2+</sub> partial current density/unit Cu weight 27 times that of a corresponding Cu-carbon catalyst under the same conditions."

abstract: "The development of Cu-based catalysts for electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (CO<sub>2</sub>RR) with stronger CO-binding elements had been unsuccessful in improving multicarbon production from the CO<sub>2</sub>RR due to CO-poisoning. Here, we discover that trace doping levels of Co atoms in Cu, termed CoCu single-atom alloy (SAA), achieve up to twice the formation rate of CO as compared to bare Cu and further demonstrate a high j<sub>C2H4</sub> of 282 mA cm<sup>2</sup> at −1.01 V<sub>RHE</sub> in a neutral electrolyte. From DFT calculations, Cu sites neighboring CO-poisoned Co atomic sites accelerate CO<sub>2</sub>-to-CO conversion and enhance the coverage of *CO intermediates required for the formation of multicarbon products. Furthermore, CoCu SAA also exhibits active sites that favor the deoxygenation of *HOCCH, which increases the selectivity toward ethylene over ethanol. Ultimately, CoCu SAA can simultaneously boost the formation of *CO intermediates and modulate the selectivity toward ethylene, resulting in one of the highest ethylene yields of 15.6%."

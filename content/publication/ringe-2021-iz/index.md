abstract: "In this issue, Gao and Wang present new mechanistic insights about the electrochemical hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions on Pt(111). For this they perform micro-kinetic modeling utilizing constant potential activation barriers derived from grand-canonical density functional theory to gain insights on the origin of the Tafel slope, coverages, and rate-limiting steps."

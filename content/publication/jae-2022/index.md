abstract: "Electrocatalysis, whose reaction venue locates at the catalyst–electrolyte interface, is controlled by the electron transfer across the electric double layer, envisaging a mechanistic link between the electron transfer rate and the electric double layer structure. A fine example is in the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction, of which rate shows a strong dependence on the alkali metal cation (M<sup>+</sup>) identity, but there is yet to be a unified molecular picture for that. Using quantum-mechanics-based atom-scale simulation, we herein scrutinize the M<sup>+</sup>-coupling capability to possible intermediates, and establish H<sup>+</sup> and M<sup>+</sup> associated ET mechanisms for CH<sub>4</sub> and CO/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> formations, respectively. These theoretical scenarios are successfully underpinned by Nernstian shifts of polarization curves with the H<sup>+</sup> or M<sup>+</sup> concentrations and the first-order kinetics of CO/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> formation on the electrode surface charge density. Our finding further rationalizes the merit of using Nafion-coated electrode for enhanced C<sub>2</sub> production in terms of enhanced surface charge density."

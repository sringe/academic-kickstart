abstract: "Methanol selectivity is uncommon among CO<sub>2</sub> reduction electrocatalysts. A notable exception is the cobalt phthalocyanine catalyst supported on carbon nanotubes, yet the mechanism is still poorly understood. Now, two studies use a variety of analytical approaches to investigate the mechanism of the process including the role of alkali cations."

                controlling product selectivity remains a great challenge. Here

                electrocatalyst for selective nitric oxide reduction into
                hydroxylamine. Using in operando spectroscopic techniques, the
                catalytic site is identified as isolated ferrous moieties, at
                which the rate for hydroxylamine production increases in a
                super-Nernstian way upon pH decrease. Computational multiscale
                modelling attributes the origin of unconventional pH dependence
                to the redox active (non-innocent) property of NO. This makes
                the rate-limiting NO adsorbate state more sensitive to surface
                charge which varies with the pH-dependent overpotential. Guided
                by these fundamental insights, we achieve a Faradaic efficiency
                of 71\% and an unprecedented production rate of 215 $\mu$mol

  abstract="Electrolyte properties in general and electrolyte ions in particular have been shown to have significant effects on the kinetics of electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction at metal electrodes, but these effects have not yet been fully understood. We investigate the effects of cations at the aqueous electrolyte–Cu(211) interface on adsorbate binding energies and the electrolyte structure using density functional theory (DFT). Charging the interface via explicit Na+ has systematic effects on adsorbate–electrolyte interactions and conformations. We describe specific local adsorbate–ion interactions, including direct alkali ion–adsorbate coordination and hydrogen bonding via ion-coordinated water molecules. The relative importance of these specific interactions and purely electrostatic field–adsorbate interactions is investigated by comparing the DFT-calculated ion effects to those predicted by purely electrostatic models of the interface and the adsorbates. We find that the trend in ion effects among different adsorbates at constant surface charge density is well explained by a purely electrostatic interaction model. The binding energy of OCCHO is found to depend strongly on the surface charge density as well as the spatial distribution of ions at constant surface charge density. These effects are also explained by a purely electrostatic local electrostatic field–adsorbate model. This indicates that alkali ion effects can be mainly attributed to purely electrostatic field interactions and that the local field at ion-stabilized active sites can depend significantly on both the overall charge density and on the spatial distribution of ions at constant charge density. This work provides new insight on alkali ion effects on a variety of adsorbates relevant to the CO2 and CO reduction reactions by describing specific local ion–adsorbate interactions, systematic changes in adsorbate–electrolyte interactions induced by explicit surface charge, and comparisons of the calculated effects on binding energies to simple electrostatic field–adsorbate models to explain trends among various adsorbates and at varying surface charge densities and supercell configurations.",

  abstract = "Atomically dispersed nickel sites complexed on nitrogen-doped carbon (Ni–N/C) have demonstrated considerable activity for the selective electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO. However, the high-temperature treatment typically involved during the activation of Ni–N/C catalysts makes the origin of the high activity elusive. In this work, Ni(II) phthalocyanine molecules grafted on carbon nanotube (NiPc/CNT) and heat-treated NiPc/CNT (H-NiPc/CNT) are exploited as model catalysts to investigate the impact of thermal activation on the structure of active site and CO2RR activity. H-NiPc/CNT exhibits ~4.7-fold higher turnover frequency for CO2RR to CO in comparison to NiPc/CNT. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the heat treatment transforms molecular Ni2+–N4 sites of NiPc into Ni+–N3V (V: vacancy) and Ni+–N3 sites incorporated in the graphene lattice that concomitantly involves a breakage of Ni–N bonding, shrinkage in the Ni–N–C local structure, and decrease in the oxidation state of the Ni center from +2 to +1. DFT calculations combined with micro-kinetic modeling suggest that the Ni–N3V site appears to be responsible for the high CO2RR activity because of its lower barrier for the formation of *COOH intermediate and optimum *CO binding energy. In situ/operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses further corroborate the importance of reduced Ni+ species in boosting the CO2RR activity.",

Here, we present Sn nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes in a hollow fiber (Sn-CHF) which produce CO with 10 times higher selectivity than formate. Density functional theory calculations reveal that a strong interfacial field induced by the carbon support enhances the rate-limiting CO2 adsorption and thus CO production on Sn nanoparticles whereas the field-insensitive formate and hydrogen production routes were completely suppressed and occurred mainly from carbon sites. Modification of the interfacial electric field via exchange of the electrolyte-containing cation from Li+ to Cs+ induces an unprecedented two orders of magnitude change in the CO current, while not changing the other products. This work demonstrates how electrochemical selectivity rules can be modulated by controlling the interfacial field, thus opening up new windows for electrocatalyst design.",

              electrochemical interface is the determination of electrochemical
              barriers under a constant driving force. Existing methods to do
              so include extrapolation techniques based on fully explicit
              treatments of the electrolyte, as well as implicit solvent models
              which allow for a continuous variation in electrolyte charge.
              Emerging hybrid continuum models have the potential to
              revolutionize the field, since they account for the electrolyte
              with little computational cost while retaining some explicit
              electrolyte, representing a ``best of both worlds'' method. In
              this work, we present a unified approach to determine reaction
              energetics from fully explicit, implicit, and hybrid treatments
              of the electrolyte based on a new multicapacitor model of the
              electrochemical interface. A given electrode potential can be
              achieved by a variety of interfacial structures; a crucial
              insight from this work is that the effective surface charge gives
              a good proxy of the local potential, the true driving force of

              show that the reaction energetics are largely insensitive to the

             remains a major challenge in ab initio simulations of charge
             transfer processes at surfaces. Recently, the development of
             hybrid polarizable continuum models/ab initio models have allowed
             for the treatment of solvation and electrolyte charge in a
             computationally efficient way. However, challenges remain in its
             application. Recent literature has reported that large cell
             heights are required to reach convergence, which presents a
             serious computational cost. Furthermore, calculations of reaction
             energetics require costly iterations to tune the surface charge
             to the desired potential. In this work, we present a simple
             capacitor model of the interface that illuminates how to
             circumvent both of these challenges. We derive a correction to
             the energy for finite cell heights to obtain the large cell
             energies at no additional computational expense. We furthermore

             eliminates the need to apply iterative schemes to tune the system

               To this end, CO2 reduction was investigated over Ag thin films
               with (111), (100), and (110) orientations prepared via epitaxial
               growth on single-crystal Si wafers with the same
               crystallographic orientations. This preparation technique
               yielded larger area electrodes than can be achieved using
               single-crystals, which enabled the electrocatalytic activity of
               the corresponding Ag surfaces to be quantified in the Tafel
               regime. The Ag(110) thin films exhibited higher CO evolution
               activity compared to the Ag(111) and Ag(100) thin films,
               consistent with previous single-crystal studies. Density
               functional theory calculations suggest that CO2 reduction to CO
               is strongly facet-dependent, and that steps are more active than
               highly coordinated terraces. This is the result of both a higher
               binding energy of the key intermediate COOH as well as an
               enhanced double-layer electric field stabilization over
               undercoordinated surface atoms located at step edge defects. As

               is then related to the larger density of undercoordinated sites

               that undercoordinated sites dominate the CO2 reduction activity

               controversy surrounding the rate-limiting step. We find the CO

               modeling scheme that integrates ab initio reaction kinetics with
               mass transport simulations, explicitly considering the charged
               electric double layer. The model reproduces the experimental CO
               polarization curve and reveals the rate-limiting step to be
               *COOH to *CO at low overpotentials, CO$_2$ adsorption at

  abstract  = "A major challenge in the modeling of electrochemical phenomena
               is the accurate description of the interface between an
               electrolyte and a charged conductor. Polarizable continuum
               models (PCM) have been gaining popularity because they offer a
               computationally inexpensive method of modeling the electrolyte.
               In this Perspective, we discuss challenges from using one such
               model which treats the ions using a linearized
               Poisson--Boltzmann (LPB) distribution. From a physical
               perspective, this model places charge unphysically close to the
               surface and adsorbates, and it includes excessively steep
               ramping of the dielectric constant from the surface to the bulk
               solvent. Both of these issues can be somewhat mitigated by
               adjusting parameters built into the model, but in doing so, the
               resultant capacitance deviates from experimental values.
               Likewise, hybrid explicit-implicit approaches to the solvent may
               offer a more realistic description of hydrogen bonding and
               solvation to reaction intermediates, but the corresponding
               capacitances also deviate from experimental values. These
               deviations highlight the need for a careful adjustment of
               parameters in order to reproduce not only solvation energies but
               also other physical properties of solid--liquid interfaces.
               Continuum approaches alone also necessarily do not capture local
               variations in the electric field from cations at the interface,
               which can affect the energetics of intermediates with
               substantial dipoles or polarizability. Finally, since the
               double-layer charge can be varied continuously, LPB/PCM models
               provide a way to determine electrochemical barriers at constant
               potential. However, double-layer charging and the atomic motion
               associated with reaction events occur on significantly different
               timescales. We suggest that more detailed approaches, such as
               the modified Poisson--Boltzmann model and/or the addition of a
               Stern layer, may be able to mitigate some but not all of the

               parameters that need to be determined earlier. In the past, the
               focus lay mostly on an accurate parametrization of water models.
               Yet, non-aqueous solvents have recently attracted increasing
               attention, in particular, for the design of battery materials.
               To this end, we present a systematic parametrization protocol
               for the Self-Consistent Continuum Solvation (SCCS) model
               resulting in optimized parameters for 67 non-aqueous solvents.
               Our parametrization is based on a collection of $\approx$6000
               experimentally measured partition coefficients, which we
               collected in the Solv@TUM database presented here. The accuracy
               of our optimized SCCS model is comparable to the well-known
               universal continuum solvation model (SMx) family of methods,
               while relying on only a single fit parameter and thereby largely
               reducing statistical noise. Furthermore, slightly modifying the
               non-electrostatic terms of the model, we present the SCCS-P
               solvation model as a more accurate alternative, in particular,
               for aromatic solutes. Finally, we show that SCCS parameters can,

  abstract  = "Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction
               (CO2RR) is a promising approach to mitigate CO2 concentration
               and generate carbon feedstock. Recently, the (sub-)nanometer
               design of catalyst structures has been revealed as an efficient
               means to control the reaction process through the local reaction
               environment. Herein, the synthesis of a novel tin oxide (SnOx)
               nanoparticle (NP) catalyst with highly controlled sub-nanoscale
               interplanar gaps of widths <1 nm (SnOx NP-s) is reported via the
               lithium electrochemical tuning (LiET) method. Transmission
               electron microscopy (TEM) and 3D-tomo-scanning TEM (STEM)
               analysis confirm the presence of a distinct segmentation pattern
               and the newly engineered interparticle confined space in the
               SnOx NP-s. The catalyst exhibits a significant increase in CO2RR
               versus hydrogen evolution selectivity by a factor of $\approx$5
               with 20\% higher formate selectivity relative to pristine SnO2
               NPs at ?1.2 VRHE. Density functional theory calculations and
               cation-size-dependent experiments indicate that this is
               attributable to a gap-stabilization of the rate-limiting *OCHO
               and *COOH intermediates, the formation of which is driven by the
               interfacial electric field. Moreover, the SnOx NP-s exhibits
               stable performance during CO2RR over 50 h. These results
               highlight the potential of controlled atomic spaces in directing
               electrochemical reaction selectivity and the design of highly
               optimized catalytic materials.",
